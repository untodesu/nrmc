### Core player disappears
A core player of the server, f12xz has disappeared from the Internet.  

> *UPDATE 2025:* we have managed to contact them IRL. They are still alive, still well, still in Kiev; they just stopped using Internet as much as they did in 2024. Hopefully that's one less problem solved in management's lives.  

Now, due to general inactivity, the server has been stopped indefinitely.  

If you have any reason for the server to be brought back to life (eg. your and your friends' 2-week phase is lurking nearby), please locate and bother any member of NRMC management at any time; we will gladly spin the server back up.

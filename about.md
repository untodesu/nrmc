title: About NRMC
---

NRMC is a Minecraft Survival Multiplayer (SMP) server designed to preserve the "friends-only" feeling of a single specific SMP server I was playing from 2018 up until 2022. NRMC features almost fully open-source configuration and this has been a core feature ever since the server's inception.  

The server's population grows based on invites. To get on you have to be invited by someone who's already playing on the server. For a while they will also be responsible for all the things you manage to mess up in there.  

This blog is dedicated to keeping track of all the server updates, datapack/mod/plugin changes and anything else related to the open-source server configuration.
